# my-react-chatroom

This is an example practising the baisc reactjs for personal use, it consists of a websocket-based chatroom, by getting started with the following:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: It didn't use `create-react-app` but the custom `browserify` and `webpack` from the bottom of `npm init`  instead
